   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(please read through to the end)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Universities prepare students for a career in research, not for an actual job. We need to reform higher education in order to make graduates employable on the private market. These are some of my suggestions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Free higher education for students of a state university so that they may accumulate new knowledge without spending unnecessary money on tuition fees.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve the quality of the education at state universities by forcing faculties to compete for students. Right now, the number of places at a university is fixed and departments do not need to be more attractive than others in order to attract students.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Offer students the freedom to enroll in more practical modules important for the labor market, like computer programming classes, office management, and team management.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attempt to connect universities with industry or private organizations. IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) is successful in this field. This may be due to the fact that they grant patents to industry partners and share the profits with them. This is good for all parties and enriches the public sector.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Students of private universities receive government funding. This support is available regardless of the number of alumni from a university, thus offering smaller private universities the possibility to participate in the program.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Students of public universities divide their funding on research and for the exchange of information and new knowledge, which they then may share with society. This publication of research results is important in order to foster the competitiveness of market economy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Government funding may be provided for master’s degrees in order to offer students more study places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, market-based reforms are needed in order to create new opportunities and prepare highly trained students for the private market. The quality of institutions will thus be on the rise, most students planning on an academic career will find employment, and salaries will be fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above essay was written by GPT-3, the current state-of-the-art NLP algorithm developed by OpenAI. I fed it the headline and the introduction (in bold), the rest was all algorithm - I deleted some sentences and added punctuation but didn’t write a single word of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of it doesn’t make any sense of course, but as an idea generator I think this technology could be extremely helpful. Imagine how hard it will be for teachers to grade papers written by this thing though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And imagine what it will do to your job.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How we beat existing network effects and got 900 customers from day one</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/07/03/900-customers-from-day-one/"/>
   <updated>2020-07-03T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2020/07/03/900-customers-from-day-one</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 2011 my company Benchmarking Alliance outmaneuvered a competitor that – in theory
– couldn’t be outmaneuvered due to network effects. Through a combination of the right
organization, product features, pricing and negotiation, we took over the Nordic market for hotel KPI benchmarking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late 2009, I was doing consulting work for the Pricing and Distribution team at one of the
largest hotel chains in the Nordics. When the project was finished, the team mentioned that
they were dissatisfied with one of their software suppliers. “If you would build something
better”, they said, “we’ll become your customer tomorrow.”
The supplier was a US company (let’s call them “FTR”) which had recently
acquired a Swedish company (let’s call them “The Bunch”) in order to enter the European market. Our US competitor was
founded in 1985 and provided competitor benchmarks on a monthly basis to most hotel
chains in the US. Every month, hotels would send proprietary data such as last month’s
audited revenue figures to FTR and in exchange receive aggregated KPI benchmarks
(occupancy, average room rate and revenue per available room) for a selected group of
competitor hotels. Over time, FTR had become the de facto standard for hotel industry
metrics and the numbers were regularly used by financial institutions when assessing M&amp;amp;A
deals or expansion plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bunch, on the other hand, was a Swedish company founded by hotel operators wanting
to optimize daily pricing decisions. Inspired by the success of yield management (dynamic
pricing based on customer demand) in the airline industry during the 1980s, hotels had
started to adopt their own version called revenue management during the late 1990s. In
order to measure the outcome of their pricing endeavors, they would need daily feedback on
whether they were accurately capturing customer demand. By launching a daily
benchmarking survey online in 2001 – using the same KPIs as FTR – The Bunch helped
hotels understand their daily performance and the company soon had customers all over
Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2007, The Bunch was acquired by FTR. However, merging the cultures of a company
operating on a monthly cycle (FTR) with one helping customers on a daily basis (The Bunch)
turned out to be hard and the Nordic customers (having all been early adopters of the
Swedish company) soon became dissatisfied with FTR’s lack of responsiveness to daily
operational questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some further research and quickly found out that several Nordic hotel chains indeed felt
dissatisfied with FTR. However, the major problem was the network effects of the
benchmarking platform. As everyone was using the platform to get benchmarks based on
each other’s inputs, I kept hearing the same story from all hotel chains: “Sure, we would also
happily switch to another supplier, but only if everyone else switches too.”
This called for a bit of creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to convince a friend with a legal degree and experience from the real estate
industry to join me and together with two former employees from The Bunch we co-founded
Benchmarking Alliance in June 2010. Our strategy to take over the Nordic market for hotel
KPI benchmarking involved a number of activities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We first created an &lt;em&gt;MVP version&lt;/em&gt; of the platform based on interviews with key customers,
and made sure to focus on an attractive user interface as our competitor’s product was fairly
outdated. We paid special attention to requirements involving KPI definitions - if
we could get a critical mass of hotel chains to agree on new local definitions, our competitor
would probably not be able to respond since they were a global company and required
consistency between countries. Even though they weren’t yet customers, we managed to
persuade several hotel chains to try out the service and start sending us numbers in parallel
to our competitor. We also prepared for system integrations with all major property
management system providers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;During our initial talks with customers, we came up with a &lt;em&gt;pricing model&lt;/em&gt; where hotels paid a
yearly fee related to their number of rooms, which would attract independent hotels that were typically smaller than chain hotels.
Our competitor had been charging a fee related to the number of &lt;em&gt;hotels&lt;/em&gt; per customer, favoring hotel chains. By presenting a model
that was attractive to independent hotels, we could convince the chains that we would be
able to present better benchmarks (i.e. including more competitors) over time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finally, we established a network of &lt;em&gt;resellers&lt;/em&gt; in the Nordic countries, who spoke the local
language and would actively work to expand our market coverage. Even though these
resellers hadn’t begun selling yet, their very presence would strengthen our case a lot.
With these things in place, we invited the ten dominant hotel chains at the time to a
roundtable meeting in Oslo, where we told them: “You have all said that you will join our
service if all other hotel chains are on board as well. Can you say that again?”. Believing that
we had everything in place for a successful rollout of our service going forward, they all
confirmed their interest again. As they all now believed everyone would join us, we could
proceed with individual contract negotiations after the meeting. We were also able to tell
independent hotels that the chains would be leaving our competitor, more or less forcing
them to switch suppliers if they still wanted benchmarking data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result was a zero-to-one launch of our business in Sweden, Norway and Denmark with
approximately 900 hotels becoming customers from start. We proceeded to secure
independent hotel participation in several small cities in order to get better
benchmarks for our biggest customers (a hotel in Stockholm doesn’t about the market in Stavanger and vice versa). This would make it increasingly hard for our competitor to take the market back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our strategy has changed somewhat since then, but I think this shows that you can actually start a company in a market
dominated by a competitor even though there are network effects. I guess the generic strategy is to focus on a local niche (like Facebook did for Harvard graduates), a new platform (like Instagram did) or a new customer behavior (like Snap and TikTok did), and hopefully we can serve as an example that you can actually do it in a seemingly boring B2B niche market too.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hiring developers - lessons from screening 1000+ applications</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/06/25/hiring-developers/"/>
   <updated>2020-06-25T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2020/06/25/hiring-developers</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you are a decent developer looking for a job you won’t have any problems whatsoever finding one. However, the opposite is true if you want to &lt;em&gt;hire&lt;/em&gt; developers (unless you’re Google or Spotify), especially if you’re not hiring a lot of them. Having worked with dozens of companies looking to hire tech talent, and having screened thousands of candidates as part of consulting gigs I have seen some approaches work better than others to find, attract and keep developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; developers, there are hundreds of channels you can use and you’ll just have to test some of them. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stackoverflow.com/&quot;&gt;Stackoverflow.com&lt;/a&gt; is probably one of my favorites since you can target your specific tech stack there (If you’re looking for Python developers you can choose to have your ad displayed next to questions about python). If you’re fine with hiring remote talent, you might want to consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://weworkremotely.com/&quot;&gt;WeWorkRemotely&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://remoteok.io/&quot;&gt;RemoteOK&lt;/a&gt; but I can’t vouch for them since I have mainly worked with remote freelancers rather than employees. I can recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://wearefram.com/&quot;&gt;Fram&lt;/a&gt; specifically for Vietnamese tech talents though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make developers &lt;em&gt;interested&lt;/em&gt; in you, these are some best practices that I’ve seen work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Describe some of the actual &lt;em&gt;problems&lt;/em&gt; you want solved, rather than just putting up a generic ad for a backend developer. Preferably you should mention open-ended problems (like &lt;em&gt;we need to pick a new frontend framework&lt;/em&gt;) as well as specific challenges (&lt;em&gt;we need integrations with Zapier and Airtable&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In as much detail as possible, tell them what’s unique about your company - but avoid cliches.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Describe your tech team (if there is one): Who would your candidate be working with? What products are you proud of, and why? Are there any specific technical challenges that you have overcome, and how?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk about the recruitment process: A professional process is not only a way to find the right people, it can also be critical for attracting the right people to begin with. If you know that you’re going to be properly assessed, that means that so were your future co-workers and therefore they are competent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To &lt;em&gt;assess their skills&lt;/em&gt;, you should try to understand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are they competent within their needed area of expertise? There are no shortcuts here - you need to see examples of their work. It can be code that they’ve written before (at work, or contributions to public github repos) or some kind of code test. Beware though - unless you’re certain that you have a strong employer brand, you should be cautious with giving assignments that require your candidates to spend hours of their free time. Instead, try to cover as much ground as possible during your interviews - one effective way is to show several short code snippets and ask your candidate questions about them: What language is this, what does the code do, why doesn’t it work etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can they make strategic choices with regards to technology? This is more important if you’re in a startup where a lot of choices regarding your tech stack are yet to be made. Ask your candidate about earlier choices that he/she made!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can they ask for help? Programming is a line of work where you can “get stuck” in ways that other professions can’t. Sometimes you just don’t know why your code doesn’t work, and you shouldn’t be afraid to ask for help once that happens. One (slightly evil) way of testing this might be to give an interview question where there’s a missing piece of information, and see if the candidate dares to ask for help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve hired them, these are some general tips to &lt;em&gt;retain&lt;/em&gt; your developers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give them everything they need in terms of equipment: A great computer (don’t underspend here!), great software (let everyone work with their favorite tools as often as you can), a quiet room of their own (sitting in an office landscape together with eg. salespeople can be devastating) and a proper budget for courses, books and resources they might need to keep their skills up to date.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure that there are always at least some interesting technical challenges to work with - this might be as simple as giving people responsability and avoiding micro-management.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be an altogether great place to work, where developers as well as non-developers feel safe and are not afraid to speak their minds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were some practical things to keep in mind when recruiting tech talent. Happy to hear your thoughts and comments on how this list can be expanded! (Easiest way is probably to follow me on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/jensbackbom/&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) and send me a DM)&lt;/p&gt;
