title: Hi!
---

My name is Jens BÃ¤ckbom and I am a venture capital investor working for Almi Invest in Stockholm, Sweden.
I am currently working with seven of our portfolio companies: [Learnster](http://www.learnster.se), [Roaring.io](http://www.roaring.io), [Lingio](http://www.lingio.com/), [EVAM Systems](http://www.evam.life/), [Alva Labs](http://www.alvalabs.io/), [ZealID](http://www.zealid.com) and [Typelane](http://www.typelane.com).

Before I started working at Almi Invest 2017 I was an entrepreneur for nine years, working with
[Benchmarking Alliance](http://www.benchmarkingalliance.com/) and
A3J Consulting (subsequently sold to [Dreams](https://www.getdreams.com/)) where I did everything from sales to system development (mainly Python/Django and various JS frameworks). Some other examples of work I've done in my career include:
- Restructuring of a newspaper division in an Eastern European country
- Research and strategy work for AstraZeneca on remote work and collaboration tools
- LTV and cohort modelling for Stardoll and Lifesum
- Headhunting for EA DICE, processing thousands of candidates and hiring a bunch
- Pricing and sales strategy study for a major Nordic hotel chain

I am a big fan of lifelong learning and see myself as a generalist rather than a specialist -
I have an MSc degree in Engineering Physics and another one in Finance and I've written a book on common misjudgements and biases.

Hopefully I'll be able to share some lessons here, more to come soon.
