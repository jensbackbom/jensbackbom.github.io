title: The art of asking effective questions in various professions
---

One might think that knowledge work depends on knowing things, which it of course does to some degree. Even more important, however, is knowing how to ask the right questions. In many professions this is a core skill from the start (eg. journalism, medicine, therapy), but as soon as you move into leadership roles you will find that asking questions takes up a lot of your time almost no matter which profession you're in. You often have limited time to ask questions, so you need to ask the right ones in order to find out what you're looking for. Let's see what that might look like in various professions:

##As a buyer
If you work in procurement (ie. buying things for your organization), you might think that you should be asking questions about deliveries, contracts, price levels etc. However, the most effective question is often *What do we actually need in order to do our job?* You might find that not everyone who asks for a new computer, phone or car actually needs one in order to do their job.

##As a salesperson
If you're a salesperson, ultimately you want to know the answer to the questions *Who will become my customer?* and *How much will they buy from me?* If you knew the answers to these questions, you could just sort them by contribution margin and start dialing. The problem is that this can be hard to find out.

##As a recruiter
Hiring people is of course all about asking questions. You need to know if a candidate will be able to do the job, if they have potential beyond the current job scope and how long they will stay. Since you have limited time, you'll probably want to make sure you cover a lot of ground during the interview. For instance, if you're hiring developers you might want to spend the interview discussing several pre-made code examples instead of having them write code (which takes much longer).
