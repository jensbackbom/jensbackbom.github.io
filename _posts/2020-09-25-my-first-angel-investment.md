title: Announcing my first angel investment
---

I am happy to announce that I've made my first angel investment! I have invested a small amount in [Strive School](http://www.strive.school/), a pan-European education provider focused on training software developers. The company is pioneering the ISA model in Europe, which might sound counterintuitive given that European universities are typically tuition free. However, the founders have shown that there is clearly a need on the market, both from the student and employer side.

There has been plenty written about Strive School already, so I won't go into further details here. For more info about the company, here are some links:
