title: You're gonna have to serve somebody
---

It may be the devil or it may be the lord, but you’re gonna have to serve somebody.

It may be 
* Your blog readers
* Your podcast listeners
* Your 1 000 true fans
* Your 25 000 followers
* Your subreddit
* Your book publisher
* Your Substack newsletter subscribers
* Your Gumroad e-book buyers
* Your growth hacking course participants
* Your mentees
* Your yoga class 
* Your dataset
* Your mortgage lender
* Your virtual assistant
* Your kids
* Your investors
* The journalists

...or it may be your mind. But you’re gonna have to serve somebody.
